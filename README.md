npmjs package name: https://www.npmjs.com/package/poi-plugin-kantai3d


# Requirement and Compatibility
This extension is tested to be compatible with
* poi 10.8.0+
* Direction connection to the game server or generic VPN services in general
* Also work with https://ooi.moe

⚠️This extension CANNOT be used together with [Kantai3D KCCP Patcher](https://github.com/laplamgor/kantai3d-kccp-patcher). 
Please only choose one of them to patch your game client.

⚠️This extension may interfere with other local file proxy tools such as KCCP.

⚠️Due to some [limitation of electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/10478), this plugin conflicts with old versions of [poi-plugin-subtitle](https://github.com/kcwikizh/poi-plugin-subtitle). Please update the subtitle plugin to 1.3.1 or newer.

⚠️If you encounter any weird behavior, immediately stop using the extension and report the issue to me.

# Disclaimer
Kantai3D is not an officially approved program. Using it may be against the Terms of Service of DMM.

Kantai3D modifies your local game client (main.js) in order to achieve the visual effects but does not modify any in-game API request and response. It does not affect your normal gameplay or game balance. 

Please use it at your own risk. 


This mod alone does not include any data from the origin game. All depth maps used are also 100% hand-drawn.
